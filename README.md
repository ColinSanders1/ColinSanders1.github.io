# CS Blog Primer

This is my blog where I'll be sharing some of the projects I work on throughout the year. You can also find my Shiny App linked on the website. 

It is still very much a work in progress, so bare with me if there are some hiccups along the way. 

If you have any questions or comments, you can email me at colinjohnsanders@gmail.com or message me on LinkedIn which is linked to the website.

Enjoy!!
